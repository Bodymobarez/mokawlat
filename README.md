### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Database Design

**Objective:** An in-depth understanding of all business needs and the design of an effective and secure database structure that meets these requirements and complies with ISO 9001 standards.

**Sub-tasks:**
- **Requirements gathering meetings:**
  - Hold intensive meetings with the heads of various departments (management, HR, warehouses, procurement, finance, projects) to identify and understand workflows, input and output data, required reports, and current challenges.
  - Document all functional and non-functional requirements such as performance and security.
- **Analysis and Definition of Permissions:**
  - Define all functional roles within the company (e.g., project manager, HR employee, warehouse keeper, financial manager).
  - Determine the precise permissions for each role regarding access to sections, and read/write/edit/delete data. This must comply with ISO 9001 principles for access control.

To get started, run the development server:

npm run dev
