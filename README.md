## Project Development Plan

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Database Design

**Objective:** An in-depth understanding of all business needs and the design of an effective and secure database structure that meets these requirements and complies with ISO 9001 standards.

**Sub-tasks:**
- **Requirements gathering meetings:**
  - Hold intensive meetings with the heads of various departments (management, HR, warehouses, procurement, finance, projects) to identify and understand workflows, input and output data, required reports, and current challenges.
  - Document all functional and non-functional requirements such as performance and security.
- **Analysis and Definition of Permissions:**
  - Define all functional roles within the company (e.g., project manager, HR employee, warehouse keeper, financial manager).
  - Determine the precise permissions for each role regarding access to sections, and read/write/edit/delete data. This must comply with ISO 9001 principles for access control.
- **Design ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):**
  - Build an entity-relationship diagram to clarify how data is interconnected across different departments (employees with projects, suppliers with procurement, materials with inventory).
- **Database Structure Design (Firebase - Firestore & Realtime Database):**
  - Identify the necessary Firestore Collections and Documents for each department.
  - Determine the optimal data structure to ensure efficient performance and fast queries.
  - Determine when to use Firestore (for structured data) and when to use Realtime Database (for data requiring real-time updates, like notifications).
  - Design Firebase Security Rules to ensure data can only be accessed and modified by authorized users, in line with ISO 9001 data protection requirements.
- **Defining Data Entry and Validation Criteria:**
  - Establish rules for validating data input across all forms to ensure data quality and accuracy, a core requirement for ISO 9001.

### Phase 2: UI/UX Design

**Objective:** Create an intuitive, attractive, and eye-friendly user interface that follows "Elite" design principles and ensures a smooth user experience compliant with ISO 9001 standards for usability and accessibility.

**Sub-tasks:**
- **Competitor Research and Analysis:**
  - Study similar ERP applications in the construction field to draw inspiration from best practices and avoid common mistakes.
- **Wireframing:**
  - Create simple initial layouts for each page and screen to determine the placement of key elements and the flow of information.
- **Prototypes Design:**
  - Build high-fidelity interactive models (Mockups) for each section and page, considering a calm and professional color palette that reflects the 'Elite' character.
  - Focus on ease of navigation and clarity of buttons and interactive elements.
